                We are 4 undergraduates from faculty of Engineering, University of Ruhuna, who are trying to build an online shopping platform for medium to small scale business owners 
                to make their own online store and do business online. This is a timely need as we face lock downs time and time again and 
                the best way the public can ensure social distancing is by staying at home. This urges the need to have more and more
                online platforms. Hence with S&D.COM even the small scale owners get benefitted. S&D.COM gives the users the comfort from shopping
                from home choosing their favourite shops.
