                We are 4 undergraduates from faculty of Engineering, University of Ruhuna, who are trying to find a way to get rid of the infection threat of current pandamic situation. NoQueue is an application designed focusing on medical centers to provide an easy to use solution to avoid unnecessary exposure to crowds in waiting rooms. It facilitates an effective and convenient way to channel your doctor and reach your doctor just on time. Our aim is to provide a significant way to minimize the infection threat of Covid-19 as well as to save your valuable time.
